Also, a note to future TCD students whom may be looking at this code. Please look at this if you are stuck 
on an assingment or confused about what is being asked. Don't just copy the code and submit it yourself. 
You are only fooling yourself and causing yourself more pain in the long run. The assingments are only worth
10% and are a learning tool.
